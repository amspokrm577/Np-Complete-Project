Running all Tests:

You can use this command to set the .sh file to an executable: chmod +x run_test_cases.sh
The expected output, actual output, and the comparison to see if it passed the test or not
is meant to output onto the command line. 

Each individual test has a description of number of vertices and edges in the .sh file

You can redirect it to output.txt by running:  ./run_test_cases.sh > output.txt
However, the run times will output on the command line and not the output.txt

You can run it with this command to have the output on the command line which will
also output the corresponding run time for each test case: ./run_test_cases.sh



Running individual Tests:

You can use this command to set the .sh file to an executable: chmod +x run_sample.sh

For your convenience, just change the name of the input file that is being read in 
to test the test you want.

You can redirect it to output.txt by running:  run_sample.sh > output.txt
Or you can run it so the output will be on command line with: run_sample.sh

The output shows the actual output of running the tests and runtime.
